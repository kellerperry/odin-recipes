        <h2>A basic, but delicious, sourdough recipe for beginners.</h2>
            <p>For sourdough newbies, making their first country loaf is a rite of passage. This easy-to-follow recipe will set you on the path to crunchy, tangy delights.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>810g Bread Flour</li>
                <li>90g Wheat Flour</li>
                <li>535g Warm water (79-82 degrees)</li>
                <li>50g Warm water, reserved</li>
                <li>18g Fine sea salt</li>
                <li>180g Mature starter</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the mature starter and 535g of warm water to a large bowl, and stir until combined.</li>
                <li>Mix the Bread and Wheat flours, then combine with the water mixture. Mix until there are no dry clumps, and rest for 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Add the salt and 50g of reserved water to the dough and mix until well-combined. Then cover with a kitchen towel and rest 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>This is the beginning of the bulk rise phase. After 30 minutes, uncover the dough and perform a set of stretches. Grab the dough from the north (or top) end of the bowl, pull upwards and stretch it over the south (or bottom) section of the dough. Turn the bowl 90 degrees, and perform the same stretch again. Turn the bowl 90 degrees one last time, and stretch the dough in the same fashion. Then cover and let rest for another 30 minutes. This is one set of stretches.</li>
                <li>Continue stretching the dough every 30 minutes until you have completed a total of five sets of stretches. After the fifth set, let rest for 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Using a bench knife, cut the dough in half and curl the cut section of dough into themselves, creating two rounds and taking care not to incorporate loose flour inside of the rounds. Let rest for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>At this point, the rounds should have spread out a bit. Lightly flour the tops of the rounds, then using a bench knife, flip one round over at a time to perform the final shaping. Pull the south end and stretch it about one third of the way up the round. Pull the east side of the dough and stretch it over about halfway across the dough, then do the same with the west side. Finally, pull the north side up and completely over to the southmost end of the dough, folding it onto itself. Flip it over so this fold is now underneath the dough. </li>
                <li>Using the bench knife and your free hand, simultaneously cup the dough and scrape the dough closer to you, stretching the surface of the dough underneath itself and creating a nice ovalular shape. Do this for each round, then let rest for 1 minute</li>
                <li>Place each round, smooth side down, into a banneton for the final rise. Place covered in a warm spot for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven with a Dutch oven inside to 500F. Once ready, flip a dough round onto a piece of parchment sitting on a cutting board. Cut excess parchment off and around the dough, effectively creating handles with the parchment, which will make it easier to lower the bread into the hot Dutch oven. Take the Dutch oven out of the oven, and carefully lower the bread inside the pot. Cover the pot with the lid and place inside the oven. Immediately lower the oven temperature to 450F.</li>
                <li>After 12 minutes, remove the lid from the Dutch oven and set beside the pot on the oven grate. This completes the oven spring section of the bake, and now the crust will form.</li>
                <li>Bake for another 12 minutes, then carefully remove the baked loaf from the Dutch oven. Replace the Dutch oven in the oven, and preheat the oven again to 500F. Once ready, bake the second loaf following the same instructions as the first.</li>
                <li>You successfully baked your first two country loaves! Let those babies cool at least 30 minutes before cutting into them, lest you risk a gummy texture. Enjoy!</li>
